  "instruction": "You are an emotional dialogue robot. Please provide the most appropriate response based on this information and the dialogue content.",
  "input": "The trouble is you don't see enough women. You never did.",
  "output": "It sounds like you have a lot of pent-up frustration about not seeing enough women, which can be understandable given your past experiences. It might be helpful to try to reframe your perspective or seek out new opportunities where you can interact with more diverse groups of people. Additionally, it may be beneficial to talk to someone close to you about how you feel so that you can process these emotions together."
