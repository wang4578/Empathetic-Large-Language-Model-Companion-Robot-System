  "input": "Well, what do you want me to do? You're old enough to know your own business.",
  "output": "It sounds like there is a lot of frustration and anger in the conversation. It might be helpful for both parties to take a step back and try to understand each other's perspectives before reacting emotionally. This could help diffuse the tension and find a solution that works for everyone involved. Additionally, it may be beneficial to seek outside support or guidance if the situation feels overwhelming or unresolvable at home."
